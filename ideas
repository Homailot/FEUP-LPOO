Arena violates the single responsibility principle:
1. stores information about where everything is (Coins, Heroes, Monsters)
2. checks for collisions
3. determines the actions for each key pressed
4. moves the hero and the monsters
5. draws everything

fixes:
1. Level could have observers on the Game class
2. Separate Arena into: Arena(storing coins, creating coins, etc...), Colliders,
